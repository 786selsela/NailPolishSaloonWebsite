   <h1>  My Name is Precious-pearl and as long as I can remember I have been passionate about nails and the beauty industry.﻿ I relocated to Texas from Michigan in 2001. I graduated from Houston Training School & obtained my license in 2002. I planted roots in the city of Houston long ago and I've been here every since.
As a nail artist, I'm always looking for ways to improve my craft so I take continuing education courses regularly. I LOVE what I do and that’s why I'll never work a day in my life.</h1>
